#  Leveraging OpenCV in Gameplay of PCG
 This project uses OpenCVâ€™s template matching and edge detection techniques to automate gameplay in Unity-based procedural content generation (PCG) levels.
Unity-based procedural content generation (PCG) levels. By recognizing patterns and boundaries, the system
allows a game bot to autonomously play through randomized levels. The goal is to enhance game
development by automating testing and gameplay, providing insights into game mechanics and level design.
